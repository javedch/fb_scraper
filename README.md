# Facebook Scraper
This tool lets you download a CSV of your 1st & 2nd degree connections

## Installation
You'll need to have python, pip, and [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) installed to use this tool. Once that's all set up:

1. Clone this repository
2. `cd` into the cloned folder 
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Get CSV of connections & IDs
Getting your list of friends is no longer possible via the Facebook Graph API, so you can use this. It has 2 modes:
1) Download a list of your connections, and 
2) Download a list of your 2nd-degree connections for social network analysis. Both modes save data to a CSV in a format friendly for importing into graph databases.

### 1st degree connections (your friends)
1. Run ```python facebook-connections.py```
2. It will open a browser window. Fill out your username & password and log in.
3. Press Enter in the terminal after logging in.
4. You should see your Facebook friends page scroll to the bottom.
5. A CSV file will be created with the data (1st-degree_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM.csv)

### 2st degree connections (your friends' friends)
Note: This could take days if you have lots of friends!

1. Get your 1st degree connections first, so you have the 1st-degree CSV file.
2. Put the 1st-degree CSV in the same folder as **python facebook-connections.py**
3. Run ```python facebook-connections.py 1st-degree_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM.csv```, with the actual filename from the first step.
4. A browser window will open. Fill out your username & password and log in.
5. Press Enter in the terminal after logging in.
6. You should the script looping through your Facebook friends' friend pages.
7. A CSV file will be created with the data (2nd-degree_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM.csv)

**Note**: This currently gets tripped up by the following situations, because the scroll_to_bottom() function doesn't accurately detect when it's at the bottom of the friends list. Please feel free to improve with a pull request!
- Friends that have their privacy settings to show no friends
- Friends with just followers public
- Rarely, some other situations# fb_scraper
